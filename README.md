# Scripts to perform POS-Tagging tagset normalization
The scripts are responsible for normalizing four different POS-Tagging annotated corpora to [Penn TreeBank's](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html) simplified tagset.

The scripts included in this repository were developed in the paper [**Defining a state-of-the-art POS-tagging environment for Brazilian Portuguese clinical texts**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42600-020-00067-7).

You are free to use and modify the scripts, as long as you cite properly.
